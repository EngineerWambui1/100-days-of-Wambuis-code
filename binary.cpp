/*Factory Load Balancer


You're managing a **factory with `n` machines**. Each machine can process a certain number of units per day. 
You need to **ship `x` total units**, and you want to figure out the **minimum number of days** required to complete the
 shipment **if all machines work in parallel**.

Input       
* `n`: Number of machines
* An array `speed[]` of size `n` where `speed[i]` = units per day machine `i` can produce
* `x`: Total number of units to be produced

---

### üéØ Goal:

Find the **minimum number of days** required to produce at least `x` units.

---

 Example:

#### Input:

```text
n = 3
speed = [3, 2, 5]
x = 15
```

#### Output:

```text
2
```

#### Why?

* Day 1: 3 + 2 + 5 = 10 units
* Day 2: Another 10 units ‚Üí 20 total ‚Üí enough

So 2 days is enough.

---

### üí° Hint:

You can‚Äôt use normal binary search on the array. Instead, use **binary search on the "answer" (number of days)**:

* Start with `low = 1`, `high = x / slowest speed * n`
* In each step, check: ‚ÄúCan we produce `x` units in `mid` days?‚Äù
* If yes ‚Üí try fewer days.
* If no ‚Üí try more.

---

### ‚úÖ BONUS Challenge:

Add constraints like:

* Each machine can only run `k` consecutive days before cooling down.
* Or: There's an overtime cost for going over `d` days.
